*2018/8/3* It costs a little big over to write everything down, so I will try to write things concisely.

*2018/8/10* There are many other stuff, and I have to make a tradeoff and slow down. And since markdown is too slight to present more, I will turn to LaTeX after Ch.5. And try to produce some conclusion word and do some numerical experiment if possible.

*2018/12/18* The next time will go deep in the details.
